Enter a filename such as "blank.txt" including the quotes, and an array with enough storage for one byte per pixel (20x24 = 480 bytes = 480 element array)
It will return a pointer to an array containing three byte color data. The colours in the array are arranged in BGR order.
I'm not sure about how colours are saved within windows. There is a chance that all palettes are identical, in which case we only need to strip the palette
once. Inside the initial array, all pixels are stored going from left to right, row by row from the bottom to top of the image. The size of the image is not stripped
so I propose to have the storage array change based on the size of the level (S/M/L)
